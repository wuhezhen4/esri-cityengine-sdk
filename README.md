# Esri CityEngine SDK

The Esri CityEngine SDK enables you as a 3rd party developer to integrate CityEngine’s geometry engine, the so-called Procedural Runtime, in your own client applications. You can develop your own procedural modeling solution, ranging from a standalone application to your own CityEngine plugins for commercial 3D/GIS tools. This means, developers can now take full advantage of CityEngine’s procedural capabilities without running CityEngine or ArcGIS. CityEngine is only needed to author the procedural modeling rules. Moreover, using the CityEngine SDK, you can extend CityEngine with additional export formats or storage backends beyond simple files.

This document explains how to install the CityEngine SDK and how to build the included examples. For in-depth documentation please see the doc directory.

* CMake 2.8.10 or later (http://www.cmake.org)
* boost 1.34 or later (http://www.boost.org)

## Installation Instructions
* The Simple Way: The SDK is installed by simply downloading and unzipping an archive from the Releases/Tags page.
* The Advanced Way: For more convenience and easy updates you may want to directly clone this repository (there is one branch per platform).

## Examples
The SDK contains a (growing) number of examples with source code. Foremost, the prt4cmd example is a comprehensive example of the PRT API. It allows you to apply a rule package onto a initial shape and write the resulting geometry to disk. We encourage you to modify and play with this example source code in order to fully explore the possibilities of the CityEngine SDK.

### Generic Build Instructions
The following build instructions apply to all examples. See the individual example sections for any exceptions or special steps.
  1. cd into the examples/[example] directory
  2. Create an empty "build" directory in parallel to the src directory of the CLI example and cd into it
  3. Generate the make files:
    * on Linux/OSX: `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src`
    * on Windows: `cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src`
  4. Build and install:
    * on Linux/OSX: `make install`
    * on Windows: `nmake install`

This will create a ready-to-run or ready-to-use installation of the example in the "install" directory in parallel to the src and build directories.

BOOST NOTE: if the example build script complains about "boost not found", please extend the cmake call in step 3 like this:
```
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
	-DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR=xxx \
	-DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=XXX \
	-DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON \
	../src 
```

### The prt4cmd CLI example
Note: all examples below assume that your current working directory is the "install" directory from above.

#### Displaying the help screen
Simply run the example without any arguments:
```
bin/prt4cmd
```

#### Specifying the license
The SDK will make use of your installed CityEngine license (node-locked or by license server).
The "-f" argument specifies the type of license:
- CityEngBas (basic network license)
- CityEngBasFx (basic node-locked license)
- CityEngAdv (advanced network license)
- CityEngAdvFx (advanced node-locked license)

The "-s" argument is only needed for the network license types. 

```
bin/prt4cmd -f CityEngAdv -s 27000@example.com
```

For simplicity, the license arguments have been omitted in the below examples.


#### Generate a building with the included example rule package
The following call will apply the rule package "data/candler.02.rpk" onto the initial shape geometry "data/candler_lot.obj".

*Windows Note: On the Windows command line, please use `Default$Lot` instead of `Default\$Lot` and omit the backslashes.*
```
bin/prt4cmd \
	-l 3 -p data/candler.02.rpk \
	-a ruleFile:string=bin/candler.01.cgb \
	-a startRule:string=Default\$Lot \
	-e com.esri.prt.codecs.OBJEncoder \
	-z baseName:string=myhouse \
	-g data/candler_lot.obj
```
Upon completion you should find an wavefront obj file inside the install/output folder with mtl and textures.

![myhouse62.png](doc/images/myhouse62.png "Building with height=62.0")

#### Generate the building with a different height
By adding the line "-a height:float=30" we change the height of the building from its default value of 62.0 to 30.0:

*Windows Note: On the Windows command line, please use `Default$Lot` instead of `Default\$Lot` and omit the backslashes.*
```
bin/prt4cmd \
	-l 3 \
	-p data/candler.02.rpk \
	-a ruleFile:string=bin/candler.01.cgb \
	-a startRule:string=Default\$Lot \
	-a height:float=30 \
	-e com.esri.prt.codecs.OBJEncoder \
	-z baseName:string=myhouse \
	-g data/candler_lot.obj
```

### The stlenc custom encoder example
The stlenc example demonstrates the use of the PRTX API to create custom encoders which are ready to be used in prt-based host applications.

Note: Libraries based on PRTX must be compiled with a specific compiler version, see requirements.

#### Use the STL encoder in the prt4cmd example
  1. Build the prt4cmd and stlenc examples using the generic build instructions above
  2. Copy stlenc/install/lib/libprt_stlenc.*  into prt4cmd/install/lib/
  3. The STL encoder can now be invoked with the id 'com.esri.prt.examples.STLEncoder'
